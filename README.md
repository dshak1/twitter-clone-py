inspired by leetcode 355 design twitter

trying to make a python and cpp backend to sharpen my syntax knowledge and get the coding reps in for both 

comparing and contrasting approaches for methods 
- defaultdict libaries vs. hashmap in scratch (python)



also will time both and see the response, retrieval times, and display findings 
to get an appreciation for cpp's supposed speed with my own example to see for myself if you know what i mean



changed keybindings as well for optmizied workflow toggling menus, is this a gateway drug to VIM??? lol
